Capturing the evolution of public sector Covid19 response sites from around
the world. Lots of governments have responded quickly and used the web to
provide essential information, and analysing how they have done will be a
useful indicator of how well they're set up for internet-era ways of working.

This was started with a list from [the Public Digital blog](https://public.digital/2020/03/18/making-things-open-is-making-things-better/)

For each site I'm capturing:

* A screenshot
* A report from [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in both HTML and JSON
* The HTML of the site and some basic text analysis

The former will show how the sites evolve in terms of the content they prioritise and
the visual design to support it. The lighthouse score gives us a picture of speed, and
coverage of the basics of accessibility.

They're stored in a way that was convenient to me when capturing them, which
may not be the easiest structure for analysis. If you want to use this data and there's
another structure that would make it easier for you, let me know.

## How to add a site

To recommend a site for us to include please either:

* Create a pull request to add it to the list.csv file
* or email covidsites-feedback@public.digital with the URL and the government it represents
