                            <p>In most people, COVID-19 manifests as a respiratory tract infection, and many different symptoms may be present. It is not possible to distinguish COVID-19 from other infections from only the symptoms – a laboratory test is required.</p>
<p>Among the reported symptoms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Runny nose</li>
<li>Blocked nose</li>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Muscle and joint pain</li>
</ul>
<p>A person falling ill with COVID-19 may experience one or more of these symptoms. It is fairly common to lose one’s sense of smell and taste for some time during an infection in the upper respiratory tract. Diarrhea has also been reported as a symptom.</p>
<p>Most people get mild symptoms and can recover at home without professional medical care. The symptoms often appear gradually. Some people get a severe form of the illness, with breathing difficulties and pneumonia.</p>
<p>The list of symptoms may be adjusted over time, since we update our information as new knowledge becomes available, e.g. in scientific studies or from the WHO.</p>
<p>The time between getting infected and developing symptoms (the incubation period) seems to be between 2 and 14 days. Most people develop symptoms after 5 days.</p>
<p>It is very important that you stay at home if you feel ill. If you can no longer manage the illness on your own, please call 1177 for medical advice (available in English).</p>

                            <p>It is difficult to compare a completely new illness, such as COVID-19, with the seasonal flu. Based on current knowledge, the two diseases show some similarities in terms of symptoms. Most people develop mild symptoms, but some get seriously ill and some people die.</p>
<p>However, COVID-19 will affect many more people in a population where it spreads. The rapid spread of disease is due to the lack of immunity against the completely new virus. Therefore, more people will fall ill from it, and more people will need to be cared for in a hospital.</p>
<p>Different versions of the seasonal flu appear every year, and the seasonal flu has been present for a long time. Therefore, some immunity has developed in the population. There is also a vaccine and other medications against seasonal flu.</p>

                            <p>Since COVID-19 can cause mild symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish between the disease and other types of illness, such as hay fever.</p>
<p>Stay home even if you have mild symptoms like a runny or blocked nose, a slight cough or a sore throat. Take your usual allergy medication. If the symptoms do not get worse, your medication relieves the symptoms, and your judgement is that the symptoms are likely to be caused by allergy, you do not need to remain at home.</p>
<p>If you experience new symptoms which you do not associate with your allergy, or if you get a fever, you should stay home until you are free from symptoms, and then an additional two days.</p>

                            <p>The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 is mainly transmitted between people via respiratory droplets or secretions from the respiratory tract. Transmission via droplets happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and the droplets reach mucous tissue in someone's eyes, nose, or mouth. The droplets fall to the ground within approximately one meter (3 ft) from the source.</p>
<p>The virus can be transmitted via contaminated surfaces, so-called indirect contact transmission, but the risk of getting infected via contaminated surfaces is considered to be very low. There are no indications that anyone has been infected with the new coronavirus from touching contaminated surfaces or items.</p>
<p>It is currently not clear how long the virus can survive on surfaces and items. The material itself and conditions in the surrounding such as humidity, temperature, and sunlight will determine how long the virus is viable. Further studies will clarify the importance of transmission via surfaces and items for the overall spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>You can decrease the risk of transmission by keeping a distance from other people in public spaces, washing your hands often with soap and warm water, avoiding touching your face (eyes, nose and mouth), and by staying at home if you are ill.</p>

                            <p>Some groups of people may get more severe symptoms if they are infected by COVID-19. For example, they may get pneumonia or shortness of breath. The older people are, the greater the risk of serious illness and death. If people also have other health conditions, the risk is even greater. Men are approximately twice as likely as women to become seriously ill and die.</p>
<p>The risk of becoming seriously ill increases gradually with age:</p>
<ul>
<li>People aged 60-70 are twice as likely to become seriously ill as people aged 50-60</li>
<li>People aged 70-80 are five times more likely to become seriously ill than people aged 50-60</li>
<li>People over 80 are at greatest risk. They are twelve times more likely to become seriously ill than people aged 50-60</li>
</ul>
<h3>70 or over</h3>
<p>The list below is of health conditions that, added to increasing age, can further increase risk. The higher up they appear in the list, the greater the increased risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Organ transplants</li>
<li>Blood cancers – existing or previous</li>
<li>Neurological conditions (e.g. MS, Parkinson’s, myastenia gravis)</li>
<li>Obesity (risk increases with increased levels of obesity)</li>
<li>Diabetes (less risk if it is well controlled)</li>
<li>Ongoing cancer treatment</li>
<li>Chronic pulmonary diseases (including asthma, but risk very marginal if well controlled)</li>
<li>Stroke/dementia</li>
<li>Other immunosuppressive conditions or treatment</li>
<li>Liver disease</li>
<li>Impaired kidney function</li>
<li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
</ul>
<p>High blood pressure on its own does not appear to increase the risk at all and therefore no longer appears on the list.</p>
<h3>Under 70</h3>
<p>People under 70 may also be at increased risk of serious illness if they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>one or more of the health conditions listed above</li>
<li>a health condition that increases the risk of serious illness if they get a respiratory infection</li>
</ul>
<p>Children are very unlikely to become seriously ill, even if they have one of the conditions or illnesses that increase the risk for adults and older people.</p>

                            <p>There are few studies of pregnant women with COVID-19, and only a limited amount of information is available. At present, there are no indications that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Risk factors such as severe obesity, high blood pressure or diabetes might increase the risk of severe illness. Therefore, pregnant women who have any of those risk factors should be careful and consult with their midwife or doctor and limit close contact with people outside of the household as much as possible.</p>
<p>It is important to avoid getting infected before delivery because a respiratory infection towards the end of the pregnancy can be difficult and might imply risks to the pregnant woman.</p>
<p>We recommend that pregnant women take extra precautions from week 36 and follow our recommendations thoroughly.</p>
<p>Mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 during pregnancy is unlikely. Children can be infected with COVID-19 but severe symptoms are very rare in newborn babies and in children. Therefore, healthy newborn babies do not need to be separated from their mother after delivery due to the risk of transmission.</p>
<p>According to available studies, breastmilk is not a source of transmission of COVID-19 and there is therefore no reason to prevent mothers from breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Information is also available from the <a href="https://www.medscinet.se/infpreg/default.aspx?lang=2">centre for knowledge about infections during pregnancy</a> (in Swedish).</p>

                            <p>Available studies show that people who smoke, or have smoked, are over-represented among the severe cases of COVID-19. However, the studies are few in number and of uncertain quality, therefore more knowledge is needed about the association between tobacco smoking and the severity of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The fact that tobacco smoking increases the risk of severe symptoms during respiratory tract infections is already well-known from e.g. seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>Some health benefits of giving up smoking appear quickly, for example increased oxygenation of the blood, lower blood pressure, and improved pulmonary function.

<ul>
<li>Talk to friends or family about your feelings and don’t hesitate to ask them for support.</li>
<li>Use reliable sources of information about COVID-19.</li>
<li>Limit the time you spend reading news and social media.</li>
<li>Keep your daily routines as much as possible, and do things you find enjoyable and relaxing.</li>

The figures change constantly, as more people seek healthcare and are diagnosed with the disease.</p>
<p>Until 12 March 2020 all suspected cases among people travelling from affected areas to Sweden were followed up with sampling and contact tracing. From 13 March 2020 the following groups are prioritized for sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hospitalised patients</li>
<li>Health or elderly care personnel with suspected COVID-19</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the number of reported cases is lower from 13 March, and that the number of cases before and after the change of sampling routines is not comparable.</p>
<p>Since many infected with COVID-19 only develop mild symptoms, it is likely that the number of cases reported is lower than the actual number of cases. Specific investigations are carried out to monitor how the disease spreads across Sweden, for example by testing influenza samples for COVID-19. The aim with such data collection is to learn more about how COVID-19 is spreading in Sweden and how healthcare services are affected.</p>

<p>People who do not need hospital care but who do need to seek medical attention and have COVID-19 symptoms may be tested if a doctor considers it necessary. For those people, a test will be carried out mainly to exclude other illnesses and to ensure they get the correct treatment.</p>
<p>Most people who become ill do not need to seek medical attention as their symptoms go away by themselves and so there is no need to test for the virus.</p>
<p>Health, medical and care staff who are at home with mild symptoms should be tested at an early stage so they can return to work more quickly if the test result is negative.</p>

<p>The Public Health Agency of Sweden is also producing recommendations on the testing of people in key occupations. Here too, the aim is to ensure that people with mild symptoms who test negative can return to work more quickly. Key occupations are defined by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB).</p>

<p>This survey is one way of gathering information about the number of people in the community infected with COVID-19. Since people with mild symptoms are asked to stay at home, mainly patients with severe symptoms are being tested when admitted to hospital.</p>
<p>It is not possible to sign up for this survey. Participants are randomly selected from the Public Health Agency's regular survey panel. Results are expected in early May. A similar, smaller survey has been done previously in Stockholm.</p>

                            <p>The coronavirus causing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly transmitted person-to-person via respiratory droplets. This means that the virus reaches the inside of your eyes, nose or mouth from droplets that are dispersed in the air when someone sneezes or coughs. The droplets fall to the ground within approximately one meter (3 ft) from the source.</p>
<p>There are reports of transmission of COVID-19 from people without any symptoms of illness. However, only a few studies describe the role of this type of transmission in relation to the overall spread of COVID-19 in the community. Based on the available knowledge about COVID-19 and similar diseases, the current understanding is that this route of transmission represents a minor part.</p>
<p>To reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community, it is important to limit the transmission of the virus from people with symptoms of illness. This is one of the objectives of the Public Health Agency's ongoing efforts.</p>

                            <p>It is not yet clear how long the virus can survive outside the body. Research on related coronaviruses shows that they can live for several days on surfaces and items, under particular conditions. Their survival depends on temperature, humidity, and sunlight. Coronaviruses are sensitive to dehydration.</p>
<p>The amount of virus particles present also determines how long a surface or an item is contagious. Such studies are done under controlled conditions in laboratories, and are not directly transferable to other environments, for example in the community.</p>
<p>A recent study from a healthcare setting where patients with COVID-19 had been isolated shows that small amounts of genetic material from the virus can remain in the environment. Further studies will clarify the role of indirect contact transmission for the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>It is important to maintain good hand hygiene. By washing your hands with soap and water you can decrease the risk of getting infected and infecting others. If water and soap are not available, alcohol-based hand rub can be used instead.</p>

                            <p>Quarantine is a form of isolation of people who are not ill themselves, but may have been exposed to a disease which is dangerous to society. Anyone who has been, or is suspected to have been, exposed to a disease classified as dangerous to society (e.g. COVID-19) can be kept in quarantine as decided by the county medical officer (under the Swedish Communicable Diseases Act; 2004:168). A person can be put in quarantine in their own home. Quarantine means that you are not allowed to leave the building or receive visitors, apart from health and social care staff.</p>
<p>For people ill with such a disease, isolation may be imposed instead. Decisions about quarantine are always individual, and patients may appeal against them.</p>

<p>The aim with this intervention is to create a zone where an investigation can take place without risk of people entering or leaving and risking further transmission of disease.

<p>This is what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain good hand hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If handwashing facilities are not available, alcohol-based hand rub is an alternative. Avoid touching you face (eyes, nose, mouth). Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or paper tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
<li>Maintain physical distance to other people, indoors and outdoors in places where people gather such as shops, museums, libraries, waiting rooms, or civic centres.</li>
<li>Maintain physical distance to other people when using public transportation such as trains, buses, or trams.</li>
<li>Avoid social gatherings like parties, funerals, and weddings.</li>
<li>Maintain physical distance to other people at sports grounds, in swimming baths, in gyms, and other exercise facilities. Avoid using public changing rooms.</li>
<li>Do not travel at rush hour unless necessary.</li>
<li>Refrain from non-essential travel.</li>

                            <p>There is now an ongoing transmission of COVID-19 in the community in several regions in Sweden. Our advice is therefore that you work from home, if it is possible to do so and if your employer agrees.</p>
<p>This is to decrease the speed of transmission and the number of people in need of hospital care. A rapid increase of the number of infected would put unnecessary pressure on healthcare services.

                            <p>To avoid getting infected the Public Health Agency urges anyone 70 or older to limit close contacts with other people.</p>
<p>As from 13 June you can travel if you do not have any symptoms. Preferably, use your own means of transport or public transport where you can book a seat in advance.</p>
<p>You should avoid travelling by public transport, e.g. train, bus, tram or subway, visit supermarkets or other venues where many people gather at the same time. Instead, ask friends, family or neighbours to do your shopping, pick up medicines from the pharmacy, or run other errands.</p>
<p>Many people feel worried, insecure and lonely under these circumstances. Remember that this situation will remain for a limited time. Try to ease your mind by doing something you find enjoyable and stimulating. If you take a walk, maintain physical distance from other people. Keep in touch with friends and family via telephone, email or social media.</p>

<p>Compared to pupils in schools and pre-schools, the students in higher education are not dependent on their educational institution for daily care. Higher education also draws students from larger geographical areas.</p>

                            <p>It is important to be considerate and use good sense when we meet other people, which means we should keep at a distance from others in public places, both indoors and outdoors. There are currently no studies to show what precise distance is safe, but in view of how the infection spreads by droplets, a guideline might be no less than an arm’s length. Another reason why the Public Health Agency of Sweden is only giving an approximate measurement is that businesses such as restaurants and shops and other public spaces need a degree of flexibility to be able to operate.</p>
<p>The coronavirus is primarily transmitted person-to-person via droplets dispersed in the air when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. Studies on infections spread by droplet transmission show that the droplets fall down through the air quickly and do not generally travel more than a metre or so.</p>

<li>Try to keep at least an arm’s length away from the person who is ill</li>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds as often as possible Always wash your hands before meals, when preparing food and after using the toilet</li>
<li>Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a paper tissue Always put used tissues into the bin and wash your hands afterwards</li>

                            <p>The Public Health Agency uses several different surveillance systems to monitor the spread of COVID-19 in Sweden. Since COVID-19 is subject to mandatory reporting under the Communicable Diseases Act, physicians and laboratories continuously supply data to be analyzed by the Public Health Agency on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Other sources of data are random samples from patients with symptoms of influenza, or from other groups of people. Statistics from the medical advice service 1177 (web searches and telephone calls) is also used to monitor the situation.</p>
<p>Collected data provides a background for decisions about interventions made with the aim of minimising mortality, the number of people affected by the disease, and the negative effects for society. Data from surveillance also makes it possible to monitor and evaluate the effects of interventions so far, and to follow and somewhat predict the further development of the pandemic.</p>

                            <p>As of 29 March, the Swedish Government has decided to ban all public gatherings and events with more than 50 people. The aim with this legislation is to prevent situations where large numbers of people from different parts of the country come together in the same place.</p>
<p>Examples of public gatherings and events are demonstrations, seminars, religious gatherings, theatre performances and concerts. Sports events, dances and fairs are other examples.</p>

                            <p>On 1 April, the Public Health Agency issued regulations and general guidelines regarding our shared responsibility to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Everyone has a personal responsibility to prevent transmission. You should avoid any large social gathering such as parties, weddings, funerals and other events attracting many people at the same time.</p>
<p>It is also of utmost importance to keep a distance to others at e.g. sports grounds, gyms, shopping centers, public transportation etc. People older than 70 should limit all close contacts with others.</p>
<p>Prior to all events and public gatherings, the Public Health Agency recommends that the organisers do a risk assessment.&nbsp;<a title="To the model (in Swedish)" href="/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/verksamheter/information-till-arrangorer-av-evenemang/">A model for assessing and addressing potential risks is available here</a> (in Swedish).</p>

                            <p>Public transport, work places and schools are not covered by the ban against public gatherings of more than 50 people. The Public Health Agency has decided that, for the time being, it is important that public transport continues to operate in order for the healthy population to be able to get to work or school.</p>
<p>According to the guidance published by the Public Health Agency, public transport operators should:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide enough services to avoid crowding,</li>
<li>limit the number of passengers per vehicle, and</li>
<li>inform their passengers about how to minimise the risk of disease transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p>The guidance applies to most types of transportation, i.e. also school bus services and healthcare transports. It does not apply to private use of one’s own vehicles.</p>

                            <p>As from 14 June activities such as sports games, matches and tournaments without spectators will be permitted for all ages. The decision applies to all professional sports, at all levels, for both men and women, on condition that the sports activity is done outdoors and in accordance with the restriction on public gatherings. The regulations and general guidelines issues by the Public Health Agency will be changed on 14 June. The advice to avoid close contact between participants will be removed, and necessary travel in connection with professional sports games at top level will be allowed.</p>
<p>Exercise and sports activities can continue, but the one responsible for the activity must take action to minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Sports clubs should do a risk assessment before arranging an activity and take precautionary actions.</p>

<p>Outdoor exercise is preferable and close contact between participants should be avoided.</p>
<p>Sports clubs should take precautionary actions in accordance with the recommendations issued by the Public Health Agency and the County Medical Officer to avoid spreading COVID-19.</p>
<p>Public gatherings are limited to 50 people. Certain sports activities such as marathons in towns and the Swedish Allsvenskan are included in this ban. The Swedish Police are responsible for these matters.</p>
<p>This regulation also applies to activities such as sports games, contests and tournaments involving more than 50 people including participants as well as audience and organisers.</p>
<p>In accordance with the general guidelines the Public Health Agency dissuades from sports games for adults. However, children and youth, born 2002 or later, can participate in sports games and tournaments as long as the regulations and general guidelines issued by the Public Health Agency are followed.</p>
<p><strong>Advice to sports clubs are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid close contact between participants.</li>
<li>Arrange training activities outside if possible.</li>
<li>Limit the number of spectators and avoid crowding.</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary travels in connection with sports games, tournaments and other sports activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General advice for all sports and exercise activities are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are ill, even with only mild symptoms, you should not participate in any activities. You should remain at home until symptoms disappear and an additional two days thereafter.</li>
<li>If you fall ill during exercise you should go home immediately.</li>
<li>Older people, particularly those over the age of 70, should avoid public spaces and minimise their physical contacts, and therefore not participate in group activities.</li>
<li>Avoid sports activities involving close contact between participants.</li>
<li>Do not share water bottles, protective gear or other equipment that might transmit saliva.</li>
<li>Wipe any exercise equipment used by many people, such as gym machines, with a disinfectant, after use.</li>

                            <p>Restaurants, bars, and cafés around the country need to take special precaution regarding the risk of crowding of people in queues, around tables, and at buffets or bars. Visitors must be able to keep at a distance from each other.</p>
<p>All visitors should sit at tables when they eat or drink, they are not allowed to stand at a bar or similar. Staff should serve food and drinks at the tables. Unless it creates queues or crowding, guests may order and pick up their food at a counter. Take-outs can be handled as usual, as long as it does not lead to crowding or close contact between people.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the venue is responsible for maintaining routines minimising the risk of disease transmission. This can for example include local guidelines about access to hand washing facilities (soap and running water) for staff and guests.</p>

                            <p>Physical activity is good for public health and it is important that children are able to continue with their normal activities as much as possible.</p>
<p>Summer camps and similar activities for children and young people (born 2002 or later) can take place in the immediate locality. Organisers of camps must ensure they reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection. They must also carry out a risk assessment of their various activities and put the necessary precautionary measures in place.</p>
<p>Please bear the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training and other activities should take place outdoors if possible</li>
<li>Where possible, divide participants into small groups</li>
<li>Increase the distance between beds and between seats in dining rooms and other spaces if possible</li>
<li>Minimise the number of activities involving a lot of people, e.g. camp leaving events or performances for parents and visitors</li>
<li>Make sure there are facilities allowing people to wash their hands frequently</li>
<li>Anyone who is unwell must stay at home, even if their symptoms are mild.</li>
<li>Make sure that there are arrangements in place so that anyone who becomes ill can get home</li>

                            <p>All organisations in Sweden must take note of the recommendations of the Public Health Agency of Sweden or County Medical Officers and put measures in place to reduce the risk of infection. This may mean limiting the number of guests who can be on the premises at any one time. Hotels, youth hostels and campsites should also make arrangements to avoid queues, such as at check-in, and advise how far apart customers should stand. They should also ensure that staff and visitors are able to wash their hands with soap and water and provide hand sanitiser. Arrangements at different sites may vary due to differences between them, for example in terms of size or location.</p>
<p>If there is a restaurant, bar, café or similar facility at a particular venue, it will be covered by the new rules for restaurants and bars. Where that is the case, the County Medical Officer may consult with the municipality and take a decision to close those parts of the venue if they do not meet the requirements.</p>
<p>It is important for people to be aware of and to follow the Public Health Agency of Sweden’s new general guidelines. The guidelines state that large social gatherings should be avoided (see further information below). Visitors should think about whether their stay at a hotel, youth hostel or campsite is really necessary. Everyone needs to help slow down the rate of transmission of COVID-19 in Sweden and not travel unnecessarily. Hotels, youth hostels and campsites can pose particular problems in that they bring lots of people from different parts of the country together.</p>

                            <p>Please consider whether your trip is necessary – we all need to do what we can in order to minimise the spread of COVID-19 in Sweden.</p>
<p>Present general guidelines on travel within Sweden apply until 13 June when they will be updated.</p>
<p>If you are ill you should not travel at all. People belonging to a risk group particularly need to consider whether they should travel or receive visitors. Those belonging to risk groups are primarily people who are 70 or over, and people with an underlying disease such as cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, or diabetes</p>
<p>If COVID-19 spreads to a majority of the regions in Sweden, we risk a situation where the healthcare system’s resources become increasingly difficult to redistribute in order to support all affected areas. It is also important to know that you need to be able to care for yourself, should you fall ill when away from home. If you require help, please be aware that resources might be limited. You should also arrange for either isolation or a way to travel home in a way that does not risk spreading the infection to others.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, previous recommendations regarding how to protect yourself and others from disease still apply.</p>

                            <p>Children represent only a small proportion of the reported cases of COVID-19. Studies suggest that infected children only develop mild symptoms. There is currently limited knowledge about to what extent COVID-19 is transmitted between children, and there are no reports about extensive transmission within groups of children.</p>
<p>Even if they have mild symptoms, children can pass the infection to others (just like adults with mild symptoms). Therefore, it is important that children with fever or cold symptoms avoid seeing other people outside their immediate family. It is of particular importance that they do not meet older people or people belonging to a risk group.</p>

                            <p>The Public Health Agency does not currently consider it necessary to close all schools in Sweden. There are no scientific evidence indicating that such an intervention would have any significant impact on the pandemic, nor has any major transmission of COVID-19 in schools been reported.</p>
<p>Closing schools and pre-schools would have a negative impact on society. For example, essential workers to the public (e.g. healthcare staff) would need to stay at home with their children. It could also put vulnerable groups, such as grandparents, at risk if they help out with childcare.</p>
<p>School is also a place of safety and stability for many children. Before closing a school, there must be plans made for alternative places where the children should go instead. However, it is of utmost importance that staff and children who have any symptoms of illness stay at home.</p>
<p>The Swedish Parliament has passed a bill (2020:148) allowing temporary closure of schools and pre-schools due to extraordinary events, making it possible for the Government or the head of a school to close schools under particular circumstances. There is also a regulation (2020:115) regarding the provision of education for pupils during a school closure.</p>

<p><strong>General guidelines<br /></strong>General guidelines are not binding, they are a recommendation as to what to do in order to comply with a law, an ordinance or a regulation.</p>
<p>You do not have to do exactly as the guidelines say. However, if you decide to do something differently, you must be able to show that you are complying with the binding legislation. The Public Health Agency of Sweden has produced general guidelines on COVID-19 and also on swimming facilities and indoor noise.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation<br /></strong>A recommendation is neither binding nor linked to binding legislation (unlike general guidelines). However, a recommendation is based on all the knowledge available on a particular subject, which means it is a good idea to follow a recommendation issued by an authority.</p>
