                            <p>It is difficult to compare a completely new illness, such as COVID-19, with the seasonal flu. Based on current knowledge, the two diseases show some similarities in terms of symptoms. Most people develop mild symptoms, but some get seriously ill and some people die.</p>
<p>However, COVID-19 will affect many more people in a population where it spreads. The rapid spread of disease is due to the lack of immunity against the completely new virus. Therefore, more people will fall ill from it, and more people will need to be cared for in a hospital.</p>
<p>Different versions of the seasonal flu appears every year, and it has been present for a long time. Therefore, some immunity has had time to build up in the population. There is also a vaccine and other medications against seasonal flu.</p>

                            <p>In most people, COVID-19 manifests as a respiratory tract infection, and many different symptoms may be present. It is not possible to distinguish COVID-19 from other infections from only the symptoms – a laboratory test is required.</p>
<p>Among the reported symptoms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Runny nose</li>
<li>Blocked nose</li>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Muscle and joint pain</li>
</ul>
<p>A person falling ill with COVID-19 may experience one or more of these symptoms. It is fairly common to lose one’s sense of smell and taste for some time during an infection in the upper respiratory tract. Diarrhea has also been reported as a symptom.</p>
<p>Most people get mild symptoms and can recover at home without professional medical care. The symptoms often appear gradually. Some people get a severe form of the illness, with breathing difficulties and pneumonia.</p>
<p>The list of symptoms may be adjusted over time, since we update our information as new knowledge becomes available, e.g. in scientific studies or from the WHO.</p>
<p>The time between getting infected and developing symptoms (the incubation period) seems to be between 2 and 14 days. Most people develop symptoms after 5 days.</p>
<p>It is very important that you stay at home if you feel ill. If you can no longer manage the illness on your own, please call 1177 for medical advice (available in English).</p>

                            <p>The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly via contact with respiratory droplets or secretions from the respiratory tract. Transmission via droplets happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also spread from person to person via physical contact.</p>
<p>You can decrease the risk of transmission by keeping your hands clean and avoiding touching your face, and by keeping a distance from people that are ill.</p>

The figures change constantly, as more people seek healthcare and are diagnosed with the disease.</p>
<p>Until March 12<sup>th</sup> 2020 all suspected cases among people travelling from affected areas to Sweden were followed up with sampling and contact tracing. From March 13<sup>th</sup> 2020 the following groups are prioritized for sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hospitalised patients</li>
<li>People that work in healthcare or elderly care, with suspected COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the number of reported cases is lower from March 13<sup>th</sup>, and that the number of cases before and after the change of sampling routines are not comparable.</p>
<p>Since COVID-19 causes mild symptoms in many of those infected, it is likely that the number of cases reported is lower than the actual number of cases. Specific investigations are carried out to monitor how the disease spreads across Sweden, for example by testing influenza samples for COVID-19. The aim with such data collection is to learn more about how COVID-19 is transmitted and how healthcare services are affected.</p>

                            <p>Since the virus is new, we have limited knowledge about which groups might run a higher risk of developing severe illness, or how much higher the risk is for them. Available data from the ongoing outbreak indicate that old age is the most prominent risk factor.</p>
<p>Older age combined with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, or diabetes is also associated with developing a severe form of COVID-19.</p>
<p>People with asthma, allergies, or kidney disease are not identified as risk groups in the available studies. However, it is unclear to what extent these conditions have been studied and it can therefore not be excluded that they run a higher risk of severe illness. If you or your child have a condition that makes you vulnerable to infectious diseases, for example problems with the immune system, you should seek advice from your doctor about how to manage your condition and how to decrease the risks associated with COVID-19.</p>
<p>A Chinese study shows that only a small proportion of the identified risk groups actually develop severe illness. It is currently difficult to assess whether these findings translate to Swedish conditions. Reports from Italy indicate that people over the age of 85 are most at risk.</p>

<p>As in all cases of pneumonia, the risk of severe illness can be somewhat higher, especially towards the end of the pregnancy. There are only few reports of children that have contracted COVID-19 during pregnancy or birth.</p>
<p>At present, there is only limited information about COVID-19 and pregnancy. We recommend that pregnant women take the same precautions as against all infectious diseases.

It states that most of those that had mild symptoms (fever and cough) got well again after two weeks. For those that developed more severe illness, it took between three and six weeks to get well.</p>
<p>Those that were severely ill had breathing difficulties (shortness of breath and low oxygenation of the blood). Some of them needed intensive care in hospital, for example with a ventilator. These types of symptoms seemed to appear around one week after falling ill.</p>

<p>Stay home even if you have mild symptoms like a runny or blocked nose, slight cough or a sore throat. Take your usual allergy medication.

<p>Wash hands often with soap and warm water, before eating, before preparing food, and after toilet use. Alcohol-based hand rub can be an alternative when you do not have access to hand washing facilities.</p>
<p>Cough and sneeze into your elbow or into a paper tissue to prevent infection from spreading around you, or from contaminating your hands.</p>

                            <p>There is now an ongoing transmission of COVID-19 in the community in several regions in Sweden. Our advice is therefore that you work from home, if it is possible to do so and if your employer agrees. This is to decrease the speed of transmission and the number of people needing hospital care. A rapid increase of the number of infected would put unnecessary pressure on healthcare services. By slowing the rate, we give the healthcare system a better chance of coping with the extra burden.</p>

                            <p>We recommend colleges (gymnasium) universities, and other institutions of higher education or adult learning to provide distance education rather than classes on their premises. This recommendation was issued 18th March 2020.</p>
<p>Compared to pupils in schools and preschools, the students in higher education are not dependent on their educational institution for daily care. Higher education also draws students from larger geographical areas.</p>
<p>This recommendation aims to decrease the rate of transmission of COVID-19, and thereby protect vulnerable groups and decrease the pressure on healthcare services.</p>

                            <p>Available data shows that the coronavirus spreads when patients are ill with symptoms and around the time of falling ill. From what we know now, transmission does not seem to occur during the incubation period, i.e. the time between contracting the virus and developing symptoms. Those that have been exposed to COVID-19 should pay attention to any early signs of illness.</p>
<p>Our stance is based on the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are robust scientific studies from the coronavirus that cause the disease SARS, which spread around the world in 2003. Evaluations of that outbreak show that the SARS-coronavirus does not transmit at all during the incubation period. Among all currently known viral diseases, transmission during the incubation period is very uncommon. Many viruses spread around the time that a patient develops symptoms. There is reason to believe that this applies also to this new coronavirus.</li>
<li>Many cases of the ongoing outbreak have been identified, but none of them have confirmed transmission during the incubation period.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our knowledge about the new coronavirus increases every day and we monitor the development closely. Our assessments are based on the latest available credible data, and any changes to our current advice will be communicated widely. The Public Health Agency of Sweden collaborates with the WHO on these issues.</p>

                            <p>The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly transmitted person-to-person via respiratory droplets. This means that the virus reaches the inside of your eyes, nose or mouth from droplets that are dispersed in the air when someone sneezes or coughs. The droplets fall to the ground within approximately one meter (3 ft) from the source.</p>
<p>There are reports of transmission of COVID-19 from people without any symptoms of illness. However, only a few studies describe the role of this type of transmission is relation to the overall spreading of COVID-19 in the community. Based on the available knowledge about COVID-19 and similar diseases, the current understanding is that this route of transmission represents a minor part.</p>
<p>To slow the rate of COVID-19 spreading in the community, it is important to limit the transmission of COVID-19 from those that have symptoms of illness. This is one of the objectives of the Public Health Agency’s ongoing efforts.</p>

                            <p>The disease spreads mainly via close physical contact between people. It is not clear how long it can survive outside the body. Research on related coronaviruses shows that they can live for several days on surfaces and items, under particular conditions. Their survival depends on temperature, humidity, and sunlight. Coronaviruses are sensitive to dehydration. The amount of viruses present also determines how long a surface or item are contagious. Such studies are done under controlled conditions in laboratories, and are not directly transferable to other environments, for example in the community.</p>
<p>A recent study from a healthcare setting where patients with COVID-19 had been isolated shows that small amounts of genetic material from the virus can remain in the environment. Further studies will show whether living viruses also remain, and if they can spread disease.</p>
<p>It is important to maintain good hand hygiene. By washing your hands with soap and water you can decrease the risk of getting infected. If water and soap are not available, alcohol hand rub can be used instead.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency monitors the emerging evidence, for example by collaborating with the WHO and other agencies.</p>

                            <p>The Public Health Agency can see signs of community transmission in several regions in Sweden. This means that several cases of COVID-19 have been identified where the patient has not travelled in an affected area or been knowingly exposed to a person with the disease. On the 10<sup>th</sup> March the risk for community transmission in Sweden was raised to ‘very high’, which is the highest level.</p>
<p>If you feel ill with symptoms including a runny or blocked nose, cough, or fever you should avoid contact with other people. This also applies if you only feel a little bit unwell. Do not go to work or to school. It is very important not to risk passing the illness to anyone else.</p>
<p>Stay at home as long as you feel ill. If your condition worsens and you can no longer manage it at home, call 1177 for medical advice.</p>
<p>Wait at least two days after getting well before you go back to work or school.</p>
<p>Elderly people run a higher risk of getting severely ill. Therefore, it is important not to visit people in hospitals or nursing homes unnecessarily. Avoid such visits if you have any symptom of illness.</p>
<p>If you work in elderly care, you should stay at home if you have a cough or cold.</p>
<p>This risk assessment is based on the current situation in Sweden.</p>

                            <p>Children represent only a small proportion of the reported cases of COVID-19. Studies suggest that infected children develop very mild symptoms. There is currently very limited knowledge about to what extent COVID-19 spreads between children, and there are no reports about extensive transmission within groups of children.</p>
<p>Even if they have mild symptoms, children can pass the infection to others (just like adults with mild symptoms). Therefore, it is important that children with fever or cold do not meet elderly people or people with immune system problems.</p>
<p>New knowledge is added every day, and we monitor the situation closely to be able to give accurate advice.</p>

                            <p>The Swedish government has decided to stop all public gatherings and event with more than 50 people. The aim with this legislation is to prevent situations where large numbers of people from different parts of the country come together in the same place.</p>
<p>The Swedish Public Order Act sets out what is meant by a public gathering or event. Examples are demonstrations, theatre performances, and concerts which are arranged for the public or to which the public has access.</p>
<p>Schools, public transportation, private functions, and visits to supermarkets do not fall under this legislation.</p>
<p>For events and gatherings to which this legislation does not apply, the Public Health Agency will issue regulations and guidance that sets out how the legislation is to be used. These documents will give examples of how people could or should apply different aspects of the Communicable Diseases Act in order to prevent transmission of COVID-19.</p>
<p>From 25<sup>th</sup> March, <a href="/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/verksamheter/restauranger-och-krogar/fragor-och-svar-om-nya-regler-for-restauranger-krogar-m.m/">Restaurants and bars are subject to specific regulations about adjustments that can decrease the risk of transmission of COVID-19</a> (in Swedish).</p>
<p>An exhaustive list of which situations that are affected by the legislation can be found in the Public Order Act 2 chapter, 1-3 §§. Further information is available from the <a href="https://polisen.se/aktuellt/nyheter/2020/mars/ytterligare-begransade-mojligheter-till-allmanna-sammankomster-och-tillstallningar/">Swedish Police</a> (in Swedish).</p>

Please take extra care and precaution if you plan a seminar or event that involves people working in healthcare services or other areas that are critically important for society.

<p>Event organisers should make sure that no one with symptoms of disease is present. They should provide information about good hand hygiene, and access to hand washing facilities for all participants.</p>
<p>Digital meetings, webinars or similar should be considered as alternatives to meeting in person.</p>

<p>General advice for all sports and exercise activities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who is ill, even with only mild symptoms, should not participate in activities. They should remain at home until symptoms clear and an additional two days. If you fall inn during exercise you should go home immediately.</li>
<li>Elderly people, particularly those over the age of 70, should avoid public spaces and minimise their social contacts, and therefore not participate in indoor activities.</li>
<li>Avoid exercise forms that involves close contact.</li>
<li>Do not share water bottles, protective gear or other equipment that might transmit saliva.</li>
<li>Wipe down exercise equipment that is used by many people, such as gym machines, with a disinfectant after use.</li>

<p>Provide access to hand washing facilities or alcohol-based hand rub, and encourage everybody to maintain good hand hygiene.</p>

                            <p>Restaurants, bars, and cafés around the country need to take special precaution regarding the risk of crowds of people in queues, around tables, and at buffets or bars. Visitors must be able to keep at a distance from each other.</p>
<p>All visitors should sit at tables when they eat or drink, rather than stand at a bar or similar. Staff should serve food and drinks at the tables. Unless it creates queues or crowding, guests may order and pick up their food at a counter. Take-outs can be handled as usual, as long as it does not lead to crowding or close contact between people.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the venue is responsible for maintaining routines that minimise the risk for disease transmission. This can for example include local guidelines about access to hand washing facilities (soap and running water) for staff and guests.</p>

People belonging to a risk group particularly need to consider whether they should travel or receive visitors.</p>
<p>There are clear indications that COVID-19 is spreading in the community in several regions in Sweden. Therefore, the Public Health Agency urges everybody to consider whether trips to cities, skiing resorts, and other popular holiday spots are necessary at this time.</p>
<p>If COVID-19 spreads to a majority of the regions in Sweden, we risk a situation where the healthcare system’s resources become increasingly difficult to redistribute in order to support all affected areas. It is also important to know that you need to be able to care for yourself, should you fall ill when away from home. If you require help, please be aware that resources might be limited.

<p>A formal advice against travelling to certain countries or regions can be issued on the basis of political unrest, violence, threats, or a risk for disease. The Public Health Agency are in close contact with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding the possible consequences of disease transmission between countries.</p>
<p>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs can advise against non-essential travel (e.g. tourist visits), or from all travel which includes business travel and all other visits. There are also situations where Swedish citizens are advised to leave certain countries.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency does not issue recommendations for individuals or groups of people. However, we may pass on recommendations based on our international collaborations with the WHO and others to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Each person must assess their own situation, based on the need to travel and the available information about the disease from sources such as the WHO and ECDC, who present the official data reported by different countries.</p>
<p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) offers information about travel to different countries. For advice regarding planned journeys, please contact your travel agency or insurance company if you have questions about cancellations.</p>

                            <p>Mandatory quarantine is a powerful intervention that is strictly regulated in the Communicable Diseases Act. Since COVID-19 is classed as a disease that is dangerous to society, the regional communicable diseases officers can decide to place healthy individuals in quarantine. This may mean restricting people’s movements to particular buildings such as their home, a part of another building, or a geographical area.</p>
<p>If a less intrusive intervention, e.g. issuing rules of conduct, can give the same effect it should be used instead.</p>

                            <p>No, but you should follow the current recommendations in Sweden. Stay at home if you feel unwell. The symptoms reported are manly fever and cough. Breathing problems, runny or blocked nose, sore throat, headache, nausea, or muscle and joint pain are common symptoms. Most people have mild symptoms that clear without treatment. Some develop a severe form om COVID-19 with breathing difficulties and pneumonia.</p>
<p>The time between getting infected and developing symptoms (the incubation period) seems to be between 2 and 14 days. Most people develop symptoms after 5 days. Individual cases may deviate from this time frame.</p>
<p>It is very important that you stay at home if you feel ill. If you can no longer manage the illness on your own, please call <a href="tel:1177">1177</a> for medical advice (available in English). Please do not visit a hospital or healthcare centre unless instructed to do so.</p>

A person can be put in quarantine in their own home. Quarantine means that you are not allowed to leave the building or receive visitors, apart from health and social care staff. Quarantine is a form of isolation of people that are suspected to carry a disease that is dangerous to society, but are not yet ill. For people that are ill with such a disease, isolation may be imposed. Decisions about quarantine are always individual, and patients may appeal against them.</p>

<p>The aim with this intervention is to create a zone where an investigation can take place without risk of people entering or leaving and risking further transmission of disease.

                            <p>Classifying the disease as dangerous to public health and to society are steps toward enhanced preparedness in Sweden. The Public Health Agency believes that the legislation needs to be in place should there be transmission in the community. The risk of this happening is currently considered to be very high.</p>
<p>The virus being classified under the Communicable Diseases Act enables the necessary preventive measures to be taken to handle the spread of the virus in the community. For diseases dangerous to public health and to society, there are a number of possible interventions including quarantine, isolation, health screenings on arrival in the country, and areas being closed off. Depending on the intervention, the decision is made either by the regional officers for communicable disease control or the Public Health Agency of Sweden.</p>

Negative test results during the incubation period do not rule out that you could be infected, and if you suspect COVID-19 you should get tested again if you develop symptoms of disease.</p>

                            <p>The Public Health Agency uses several different surveillance systems to monitor the spread of COVID-19 in Sweden. Since COVID-19 is subject to mandatory reporting under the Communicable Diseases Act, physicians and laboratories continuously supply data that is analysed by the Public Health Agency every day. Other sources of data are random samples from patients that present to their healthcare provider with symptoms of influenza, or from other groups of people. Statistics from the medical advice service 1177 (web searches and telephone calls) is also used to monitor the situation. The Public Health Agency issues a weekly report showing the number of COVID-19 cases, starting from March 20<sup>th</sup> 2020.</p>
<p>Collected data provides a background for decisions about interventions that serve to minimise mortality, the number of people affected by the disease, and the negative effects for society. Data from surveillance also makes it possible to monitor and evaluate the effects of interventions so far, and to follow and somewhat predict the further development of the pandemic.</p>
