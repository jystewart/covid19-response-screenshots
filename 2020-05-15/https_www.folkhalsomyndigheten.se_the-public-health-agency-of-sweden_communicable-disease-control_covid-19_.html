                            <p>In most people, COVID-19 manifests as a respiratory tract infection, and many different symptoms may be present. It is not possible to distinguish COVID-19 from other infections from only the symptoms – a laboratory test is required.</p>
<p>Among the reported symptoms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Runny nose</li>
<li>Blocked nose</li>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Muscle and joint pain</li>
</ul>
<p>A person falling ill with COVID-19 may experience one or more of these symptoms. It is fairly common to lose one’s sense of smell and taste for some time during an infection in the upper respiratory tract. Diarrhea has also been reported as a symptom.</p>
<p>Most people get mild symptoms and can recover at home without professional medical care. The symptoms often appear gradually. Some people get a severe form of the illness, with breathing difficulties and pneumonia.</p>
<p>The list of symptoms may be adjusted over time, since we update our information as new knowledge becomes available, e.g. in scientific studies or from the WHO.</p>
<p>The time between getting infected and developing symptoms (the incubation period) seems to be between 2 and 14 days. Most people develop symptoms after 5 days.</p>
<p>It is very important that you stay at home if you feel ill. If you can no longer manage the illness on your own, please call 1177 for medical advice (available in English).</p>

                            <p>It is difficult to compare a completely new illness, such as COVID-19, with the seasonal flu. Based on current knowledge, the two diseases show some similarities in terms of symptoms. Most people develop mild symptoms, but some get seriously ill and some people die.</p>
<p>However, COVID-19 will affect many more people in a population where it spreads. The rapid spread of disease is due to the lack of immunity against the completely new virus. Therefore, more people will fall ill from it, and more people will need to be cared for in a hospital.</p>
<p>Different versions of the seasonal flu appear every year, and the seasonal flu has been present for a long time. Therefore, some immunity has developed in the population. There is also a vaccine and other medications against seasonal flu.</p>

                            <p>Since COVID-19 can cause mild symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish between the disease and other types of illness, such as hay fever.</p>
<p>Stay home even if you have mild symptoms like a runny or blocked nose, a slight cough or a sore throat. Take your usual allergy medication. If the symptoms do not get worse, your medication relieves the symptoms, and your judgement is that the symptoms are likely to be caused by allergy, you do not need to remain at home.</p>
<p>If you experience new symptoms that you do not associate with your allergy, or if you get a fever, you should stay home until they have cleared, and then an additional two days.</p>

                            <p>The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 is mainly transmitted between people via respiratory droplets or secretions from the respiratory tract. Transmission via droplets happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and the droplets reach mucous tissue in someone's eyes, nose, or mouth. The droplets fall to the ground within approximately one meter (3 ft) from the source.</p>
<p>The virus can also be transmitted via contaminated surfaces, so-called indirect contact transmission. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the disease can spread via items. It is currently not clear how long the virus can survive on surfaces and items. The material itself and conditions in the surrounding such as humidity, temperature, and sunlight will determine how long the virus is viable. Further studies will clarify the importance of transmission via surfaces and items for the overall spreading of COVID-19.</p>
<p>You can decrease the risk of transmission by keeping a distance from other people in public spaces, washing your hands often with soap and warm water, avoiding touching your face (eyes, nose and mouth), and by staying at home if you are ill.</p>

                            <p>There are reports of an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 among certain groups of people. Since the virus is new, we have limited knowledge about which groups might run a higher risk of developing severe illness. Available data from studies of COVID-19 indicate that old age is the most prominent risk factor. Therefore, people over the age of 70 is the main group at risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>Older people with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, or diabetes are over-represented among the severe cases of COVID-19. People with several pre-existing conditions are at a particularly high risk.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that people with illnesses or medical treatment affecting the immune system run a higher risk of developing severe illness. If you have a condition that makes you vulnerable to severe forms of respiratory tract infections, even if you are younger than 70 years, you should seek advice from your doctor about how to handle your condition and how to reduce the risks associated with COVID-19.</p>

                            <p>There are few studies of pregnant women with COVID-19, and only a limited amount of information is available. At present, there are no indications that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Risk factors such as severe obesity, high blood pressure or diabetes might increase the risk for severe illness. Therefore, pregnant women who have any of those risk factors should be careful and consult with their midwife or doctor and limit close contact with people outside of the household as much as possible.</p>
<p>It is important to avoid getting infected before delivery because a respiratory infection towards the end of the pregnancy can be difficult and might imply risks to the pregnant woman.</p>
<p>At present, there is only limited information about COVID-19 and pregnancy. We recommend that pregnant women take the same precautions as against all infectious diseases.</p>
<p>There are only few reports of children who have contracted COVID-19 during pregnancy or birth.</p>
<p>According to studies done so far, the virus has not been detected in breast milk.</p>
<p>Information is also available from the <a href="https://www.medscinet.se/infpreg/default.aspx?lang=2">centre for knowledge about infections during pregnancy</a> (in Swedish).</p>

<p>The fact that tobacco smoking increases the risk of severe symptoms during respiratory tract infections is already well-known from e.g. seasonal influenza.</p>

<p>Until 12 March 2020 all suspected cases among people travelling from affected areas to Sweden were followed up with sampling and contact tracing. From 13 March 2020 the following groups are prioritized for sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hospitalised patients</li>
<li>Health or elderly care personnel with suspected COVID-19</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the number of reported cases is lower from 13 March, and that the number of cases before and after the change of sampling routines are not comparable.</p>
<p>Since many infected with COVID-19 only develop mild symptoms, it is likely that the number of cases reported is lower than the actual number of cases. Specific investigations are carried out to monitor how the disease spreads across Sweden, for example by testing influenza samples for COVID-19. The aim with such data collection is to learn more about how COVID-19 is spreading in Sweden and how healthcare services are affected.</p>

<p>This survey is one way of gathering information about the number of people in the community infected with COVID-19. Since people with mild symptoms are asked to stay at home, mainly patients with severe symptoms are being tested when admitted to hospital.</p>
<p>It is not possible to sign up for this survey. Participants are randomly selected from the Public Health Agency's regular survey panel. Results are expected in early May. A similar, smaller survey has been done previously in Stockholm.</p>

                            <p>The coronavirus causing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly transmitted person-to-person via respiratory droplets. This means that the virus reaches the inside of your eyes, nose or mouth from droplets that are dispersed in the air when someone sneezes or coughs. The droplets fall to the ground within approximately one meter (3 ft) from the source.</p>
<p>There are reports of transmission of COVID-19 from people without any symptoms of illness. However, only a few studies describe the role of this type of transmission in relation to the overall spreading of COVID-19 in the community. Based on the available knowledge about COVID-19 and similar diseases, the current understanding is that this route of transmission represents a minor part.</p>
<p>To reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community, it is important to limit the transmission of the virus from people with symptoms of illness. This is one of the objectives of the Public Health Agency's ongoing efforts.</p>

                            <p>It is not yet clear how long the virus can survive outside the body. Research on related coronaviruses shows that they can live for several days on surfaces and items, under particular conditions. Their survival depends on temperature, humidity, and sunlight. Coronaviruses are sensitive to dehydration.</p>
<p>The amount of virus particles present also determines how long a surface or an item is contagious. Such studies are done under controlled conditions in laboratories, and are not directly transferable to other environments, for example in the community.</p>
<p>A recent study from a healthcare setting where patients with COVID-19 had been isolated shows that small amounts of genetic material from the virus can remain in the environment. Further studies will clarify the role of indirect contact transmission for the spreading of COVID-19.</p>
<p>It is important to maintain good hand hygiene. By washing your hands with soap and water you can decrease the risk of getting infected and infecting others. If water and soap are not available, alcohol-based hand rub can be used instead.</p>

A lockdown can be used when one or more people have fallen ill with a life-threatening disease within a particular geographical area. The lockdown then serves to make it possible to find the source, and to identify any other cases of disease or transmission.</p>
<p>The aim with this intervention is to create a zone where an investigation can take place without risk of people entering or leaving and risking further transmission of disease. When the investigation is finished and anyone exposed has received the appropriate care or waited through the incubation period, the lockdown should be lifted.</p>

                            <p>Since the coronavirus causing COVID-19 is classified as dangerous to society, the county medical officers can decide to put healthy people in quarantine. This means that people are ordered to stay within a particular building, e.g. their home, in a specific part of a building, or in a geographical area.</p>
<p>However, putting someone in quarantine is a forceful intervention, strictly regulated in the Communicable Diseases Act. If a less intrusive intervention, for example particular hygiene routines or suspension from work, school or daycare, can achieve the same effect it should be used instead.</p>

<p>This is what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain good hand hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If handwashing facilities are not available, alcohol-based hand rub is an alternative. Avoid touching you face (eyes, nose, mouth). Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or paper tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
<li>Maintain physical distance to other people, indoors and outdoors in places where people gather such as shops, museums, libraries, waiting rooms, or civic centres.</li>
<li>Maintain physical distance to other people when using public transportation such as trains, buses, or trams.</li>
<li>Avoid social gatherings like parties, funerals, and weddings.</li>
<li>Maintain physical distance to other people at sports grounds, in swimming baths, in gyms, and other exercise facilities. Avoid using public changing rooms.</li>
<li>Do not travel at rush hour unless necessary.</li>
<li>Refrain from non-essential travel.</li>

                            <p>There is now an ongoing transmission of COVID-19 in the community in several regions in Sweden. Our advice is therefore that you work from home, if it is possible to do so and if your employer agrees.</p>
<p>This is to decrease the speed of transmission and the number of people in need of hospital care. A rapid increase of the number of infected would put unnecessary pressure on healthcare services.

<p>Many people feel worried, insecure and lonely under these circumstances. Remember that this situation will only remain for a limited time. Try to ease your mind by doing something you find enjoyable and stimulating. If you take a walk, maintain physical distance from other people.

<p>Other sources of data are random samples from patients with symptoms of influenza, or from other groups of people. Statistics from the medical advice service 1177 (web searches and telephone calls) is also used to monitor the situation.</p>
<p>Collected data provides a background for decisions about interventions made with the aim of minimising mortality, the number of people affected by the disease, and the negative effects for society. Data from surveillance also makes it possible to monitor and evaluate the effects of interventions so far, and to follow and somewhat predict the further development of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Examples of public gatherings and events are demonstrations, seminars, religious gatherings, theatre performances and concerts. Sports events, dances and fairs are other examples.</p>
<p>From 25 March, <a title="More information (in Swedish)" href="/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/verksamheter/restauranger-och-krogar/fragor-och-svar-om-nya-regler-for-restauranger-krogar-m.m/">Restaurants and bars are subject to specific regulations about adjustments that can decrease the risk of transmission of COVID-19</a> (in Swedish).</p>
<p>An exhaustive list of situations affected by the legislation can be found in the Public Order Act 2 chapter, 1-3 §§.

                            <p>On 1 April, the Public Health Agency issued regulations and general advice regarding our shared responsibility to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Everyone is thus personally responsible andshould avoid any large social gathering such as parties, weddings, funerals and other events attracting many people at the same time.</p>
<p>It is also of utmost importance to keep a distance to others at e.g. sports grounds, gyms, shopping centers, public transportation etc. People older than 70 should limit all close contacts with others.</p>
<p>Prior to all events and gatherings planning to attract less than 50 people, the Public Health Agency recommends that the organisers do a risk assessment. <a title="To the model (in Swedish)" href="/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/verksamheter/information-till-arrangorer-av-evenemang/">A model for assessing and addressing potential risks is available here</a> (in Swedish).</p>

                            <p>Public transport, work places and schools are not covered by the ban against public gatherings of more than 50 people. The Public Health Agency has decided that, for the time being, it is important that public transport continues to operate in order for the healthy population to be able to get to work or school.</p>
<p>According to the guidance published by the Public Health Agency, public transport operators should:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide enough services to avoid crowding,</li>
<li>limit the number of passengers per vehicle, and</li>
<li>inform their passengers about how to minimise the risk of disease transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p>The guidance applies to most types of transportation, i.e. also school bus services and healthcare transports. It does not apply to private use of one’s own vehicles.</p>

                            <p>Exercise and sport activities can continue, but precautionary measures should be taken in order to minimise the risk for transmission of COVID-19. Outdoor exercise is preferable.</p>
<p>Public gatherings are limited to 50 people. This regulation also applies to activities such as sports games, contests and tournaments involving more than 50 people including participants as well as audience and organizers.</p>
<p>In accordance with general advice the Public Health Agency dissuades from sports games for adults. However, children and youth, born 2002 or later, can participate in sports games and tournaments as long as the regulations and general advice issued by the Public Health Agency are followed.</p>
<p><strong>Advice to sports clubs are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid close contact between participants.</li>
<li>Arrange training activities outside if possible.</li>
<li>Limit the number of spectators and avoid crowding.</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary travels in connection with sports games, tournaments and other sports activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General advice for all sports and exercise activities are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are ill, even with only mild symptoms, you should not participate in any activities. You should remain at home until symptoms disappear and an additional two days thereafter. If you fall ill during exercise you should go home immediately.</li>
<li>Older people, particularly those over the age of 70, should avoid public spaces and minimise their social contacts, and therefore not participate in indoor activities.</li>
<li>Avoid sports activities involving close contact between participants.</li>
<li>Do not share water bottles, protective gear or other equipment that might transmit saliva.</li>
<li>Wipe any exercise equipment used by many people, such as gym machines, with a disinfectant, after use.</li>
<li>Provide access to hand washing facilities or alcohol-based hand rub, and encourage everybody to maintain good hand hygiene.</li>

                            <p>Restaurants, bars, and cafés around the country need to take special precaution regarding the risk of crowding of people in queues, around tables, and at buffets or bars. Visitors must be able to keep at a distance from each other.</p>
<p>All visitors should sit at tables when they eat or drink, they are not allowed to stand at a bar or similar. Staff should serve food and drinks at the tables. Unless it creates queues or crowding, guests may order and pick up their food at a counter. Take-outs can be handled as usual, as long as it does not lead to crowding or close contact between people.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the venue is responsible for maintaining routines minimizing the risk for of disease transmission. This can for example include local guidelines about access to hand washing facilities (soap and running water) for staff and guests.</p>

People belonging to a risk group particularly need to consider whether they should travel or receive visitors.</p>
<p>There are clear indications that COVID-19 is spreading in the community in several regions in Sweden. Therefore, the Public Health Agency urges everybody to consider whether trips to cities, skiing resorts, and other popular holiday spots are necessary at this time.</p>
<p>If COVID-19 spreads to a majority of the regions in Sweden, we risk a situation where the healthcare system’s resources become increasingly difficult to redistribute in order to support all affected areas. It is also important to know that you need to be able to care for yourself, should you fall ill when away from home. If you require help, please be aware that resources might be limited.

                            <p>Children represent only a small proportion of the reported cases of COVID-19. Studies suggest that infected children develop very mild symptoms. There is currently very limited knowledge about to what extent COVID-19 spreads between children, and there are no reports about extensive transmission within groups of children.</p>
<p>Even if they have mild symptoms, children can pass the infection to others (just like adults with mild symptoms). Therefore, it is important that children with fever or cold do not meet elderly people or people with immune system problems.</p>
<p>New knowledge is added every day, and we monitor the situation closely to be able to give accurate advice.</p>

                            <p>The Public Health Agency does not currently consider it necessary to close all schools in Sweden. There are no scientific evidence indicating that such an intervention would have any significant impact on the pandemic, nor has any major transmission of COVID-19 in schools been reported.</p>
<p>Closing schools and pre-schools would have a negative impact on society. For example, essential workers to the public (e.g. healthcare staff) would need to stay at home with their children. It could also put vulnerable groups, such as grandparents, at risk if they help out with childcare.</p>
<p>School is also a place of safety and stability for many children. Before closing a school, there must be plans made for alternative places where the children should go instead. However, it is of utmost importance that staff and children who have any symptoms of illness stay at home.</p>
<p>The Swedish parliament has passed a bill (2020:148) allowing temporary closure of schools and pre-schools due to extraordinary events, making it possible for the Government or the head of a school to close schools under particular circumstances. There is also a regulation (2020:115) regarding the provision of education for pupils during a school closure.</p>

                            <p>One important mission of the Public Health Agency is to disseminate scientifically based knowledge that prevents ill-health and disease and supports society in the work against health threats. The Public Health Agency closely monitors the course of events when it comes to COVID-19, conducts microbiological analyses, and assesses risks and developments of the outbreak. Health care, regional infectious disease control units and other stakeholders are informed about the current situation and the Agency also decides on what relevant measures to take. There is a close collaboration with other state agencies (e.g. Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) and National Board of Health and Welfare), the regional infectious disease control units, as well as with the World Health Organization WHO, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ECDC.</p>
